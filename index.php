                <p>Twenty years ago, the quilting world was opened up to Jean via her step mom Cay and an ambitious project - a queen sized quilt called the Tennassee Waltz. An avid seamstress in her youth, Jean took to quilting right away.</p>
                <p>Fast forward twenty years...retired and ready for a new challenge Jean decided to combine her passions: quilting and writing. Inspired by a trip to the beach with her grandson, a silly time of rhyming and throwing stones, Surprise: A Storybook Quilt was born.</p>
                <p>This site contains just some of the projects this busy grandma has been working on, from books to quilts.</p>
