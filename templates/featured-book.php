        Duff Fraser can’t leave his stutter behind even on the soccer field. Ambushed by a bully from the rival team, he limps home. Duff and his dad team up to create the F.U.S.E., a device that alters brain pathways and lets Duff speak normally. Then hoodlums snatch his dad off the street. Will Duff, armed with newfound confidence, robots, drones, and best of all, good friends, be able to find him?

        Tangled Tongue is a coming of age quest novel comparable to The Truth as Told by Mason Buttle and Fish in a Tree. This middle-grade adventure features self-reliance, friendship, and technology. A perfect read for back to school — no matter what that looks like.
